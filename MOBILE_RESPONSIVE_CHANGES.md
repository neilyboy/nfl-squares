## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to make the NFL Squares application mobile-responsive while preserving the existing desktop/touchscreen experience.

### 4. Board Display Component
**File:** `/src/components/board-view.tsx`

  - Desktop: 640px (original size)
- **Responsive Text:**
  - Player initials: text-xs on mobile vs text-sm on desktop

## What Was NOT Changed

### Desktop/Touchscreen Experience
