   - Set quarter payouts (default: 25% each = 100% total)
   - Add your PayPal/Venmo username (or enable cash)
   - Click "Create Board"

4. **Test User Flow**

```

Your data is saved in `./data/nfl-squares.db` (backed up with the Docker volume).

## Common Tasks

### Backup Your Data
**Option 1: Admin Interface**
1. Admin Dashboard ‚Üí "Backup Data"
2. JSON file downloads
3. Save it somewhere safe

**Option 2: Manual**
```bash
# Development
cp prisma/dev.db backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).db

# Docker
docker cp nfl-squares:/app/data/nfl-squares.db backup.db
```

### Reset Everything
```bash
# Stop and remove everything (including database!)
docker-compose down -v

# Or just reset the database
rm -f prisma/dev.db
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### Change Port
```bash
# Development
PORT=3001 npm run dev

# Docker (edit docker-compose.yml)
ports:
  - "3001:3000"
```

## Raspberry Pi Touchscreen Kiosk

For a dedicated party display:

```bash
# 1. Point your Pi to your server
# Edit: ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

@chromium-browser --kiosk http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3000

# 2. Reboot
sudo reboot
```

## Troubleshooting

**Can't install dependencies?**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Database errors?**
```bash
rm -f prisma/dev.db
npx prisma migrate dev
```

**Port already in use?**
```bash
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

**Docker not working?**
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d --build
```
