```

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables

- **AdminSettings**: Stores hashed PIN and recovery password
- **Board**: Game info, costs, payouts, status
- **Square**: Individual square selections
- **PaymentConfig**: Payment method configuration per board
- **Winner**: Quarter winners and payouts

### Relationships

- Board → has many Squares
- Board → has one PaymentConfig
- Board → has many Winners (one per quarter)

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Local Development
```bash
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```

### Docker (Recommended for Production)
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Server Deployment
- Runs on Ubuntu server
- Accessible via network IP
- Persistent SQLite database in mounted volume
- Auto-restarts on failure

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Database**: SQLite (perfect for single-server deployment)
- **API Polling**: 30-second intervals (respects ESPN rate limits)
- **Caching**: Next.js automatic caching for static assets
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic via Next.js

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Test Checklist

1. **First-Time Setup**
   - Create PIN and password
   - Verify login works
   - Test password recovery

2. **Board Creation**
   - Select a game
   - Configure all settings
   - Verify board appears on main screen

3. **User Flow**
   - Select a square
   - Enter name with keyboard
   - Complete payment flow
   - Verify square is reserved

4. **Board Finalization**
   - Fill some squares
   - Finalize board
   - Verify numbers appear

5. **Live Game**
   - Wait for game to start
   - Verify scores update
   - Check potential winner highlighting
   - Verify quarter winners

6. **Admin Management**
